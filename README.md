# 10-fold cross-validation using transfer learning models for image classification

This repository includes the code for a 10-fold cross-validation using transfer learning models for image classification. The following transfer learning models are used:

- VGG16
- ResNet50
- MobileNetV2
- InceptionV3
- DenseNet121
- EfficientNetB0

## Dataset

The dataset used for this cross-validation can be found in the `data` folder. It contains images of two classes (class A and class B) stored in two separate folders.
